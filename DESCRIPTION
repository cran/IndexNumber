Description: We provide an R tool for teaching in Social Sciences. It allows the computation of index numbers. It is a measure of the evolution of a fixed magnitude for only a product of for several products. It is very useful in Social Sciences. Among others, we obtain simple index numbers (in chain or in serie), index numbers for not only a product or weighted index numbers as the Laspeyres index (Laspeyres, 1864), the Paasche index (Paasche, 1874) or the Fisher index (Lapedes, 1978).
